# Loan-prediction

## Research Aim
The aim of this research is to explore the factors that influence loan approval in a dataset. The study will primarily focus on variables like Credit History, Income, Marital Status, and Education and their potential impact on the likelihood of loan approval. The research will also test various hypotheses using statistical techniques such as logistic regression, Chi-square tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

Dataset: [Loan Prediction Problem Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset?select=train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv)

## Key Variables
1. **Gender** (Categorical: Male 82.08%, Female 17.92%)
2. **Married** (Categorical: TRUE 64.79%, FALSE 35.21%)
3. **Education** (Categorical: TRUE 79.79%, FALSE 20.21%)
4. **Self_Employed** (Categorical: TRUE 13.75%, FALSE 86.25%)
5. **ApplicantIncome** (Continuous)

8. **Credit_History** (Categorical: TRUE 85.42%, FALSE 14.58%)
9. **Property_Area** (Categorical: Semiurban 39.79%, Rural 28.96%, Urban 31.25%)
10. **Loan_Status** (Categorical: TRUE 69.17%, FALSE 30.83%)

## Natural Hypotheses
1. ApplicantIncome is a significant factor in the likelihood of loan approval.
2. MaritalStatus is a significant factor in the likelihood of loan approval.
3. LoanAmount is a significant factor in the likelihood of loan approval.
4. The expected income for male applicants is less than or equal to 6000.

## General Assumption
- Loan approval can be predicted in general by using information from the 10 variables listed above.
